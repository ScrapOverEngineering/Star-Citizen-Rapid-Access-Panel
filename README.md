# Star-Citizen-Rapid-Access-Panel
custom controller for star citizen based on atmega USB enabled uC's

At the moment it's based on atmels AVR271 appnote

I imported the atmel example files into Atmel studio 7
changed the board name from stk526 to at90proto
The board was designed for a at90usb162, but now has a atmega32u2 uC

This is my first attempt at publishing something on git, don't really know how it works yet
